Time Complexity: 
    O(n log n)
Advantages of Heap Sort
    Efficient Time Complexity: Heap Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases. This makes it efficient for sorting large datasets. The log n factor comes from the height of the binary heap, and it ensures that the algorithm maintains good performance even with a large number of elements.
    Memory Usage – Memory usage can be minimal (by writing an iterative heapify() instead of a recursive one). So apart from what is necessary to hold the initial list of items to be sorted, it needs no additional memory space to work
    Simplicity – It is simpler to understand than other equally efficient sorting algorithms because it does not use advanced computer science concepts such as recursion.
Disadvantages of Heap Sort
    Costly : Heap sort is costly as the constants are higher compared to merge sort even if the time complexity is O(n Log n) for both.
    Unstable : Heap sort is unstable. It might rearrange the relative order.
    Inefficient: Heap Sort is not very efficient because of the high constants in the time complexity.
