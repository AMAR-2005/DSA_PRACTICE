/*
Time Complexity:
    Best Case: In the best case, the key might be present at the first index. So the best case complexity is O(1)
    Worst Case: In the worst case, the key might be present at the last index i.e., opposite to the end from which the search has started in the list. So the worst-case complexity is O(N) where N is the size of the list.
    Average Case: O(N)
